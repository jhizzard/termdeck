# Changelog

All notable changes to TermDeck will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Rumen v0.1: async learning layer that surfaces relevant past work proactively (see `docs/RUMEN-PLAN.md`)
- Control panel dashboard with Yes/No buttons for AI agent permission prompts
- Wire the "Ask about this terminal" input to the RAG query endpoint
- npm packaging with prebuild-install for node-pty (so `npx termdeck` works without a C++ compiler)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- Hero screenshot and 30-second demo GIF in README
- `CONTRIBUTORS.md` documenting Joshua Izzard as sole author
- 4 reference docs in `docs/`: Rumen architecture plan, Rumen deploy checklist, Podium-derived lessons, cross-project analysis methodology
- Promotion drafts for v0.1 launch (Show HN, tweet thread, dev.to article, Reddit posts)

### Changed
- All 12 silent `catch {}` blocks replaced with `[tag]`-prefixed `console.error` calls. The 2 intentional require() fallbacks at module load are preserved.
- Established `[tag]` logging convention: `[pty]`, `[ws]`, `[db]`, `[rag]`, `[config]`, `[cli]`, `[client]`
- Tight loops (fitAll, 3-second session poll) use rate-limited one-shot warnings to avoid console spam

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Core PTY + WebSocket loop**: real PTY terminals via node-pty, one WebSocket per session, xterm.js client
- **6 grid layouts** (1x1, 2x1, 2x2, 3x2, 2x4, 4x2) plus focus and half modes
- **Output analyzer**: detects Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Python servers, plain shells; extracts status, ports, request counts, last commands
- **8 curated terminal themes**: Tokyo Night, Rosé Pine Dawn, Catppuccin Mocha, GitHub Light, Dracula, Solarized Dark, Nord, Gruvbox Dark
- **SQLite persistence** for sessions, commands, and RAG events
- **Project-aware launcher**: `~/.termdeck/config.yaml` defines projects with auto-cd and default themes
- **macOS .app launcher** (no terminal needed to start)
- **Windows installer** with Start Menu and Desktop shortcuts
- **WebSocket auto-reconnect** with exponential backoff
- **Status broadcast** every 2 seconds for live metadata updates
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Ctrl+Shift+N for prompt bar, Ctrl+Shift+1-6 for layouts, Ctrl+Shift+]/[ to cycle terminals, Escape to exit focus
