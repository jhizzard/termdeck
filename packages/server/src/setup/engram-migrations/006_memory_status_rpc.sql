-- Engram migration 006 — memory_status_aggregation RPC
--
-- Why: `memoryStatus()` previously did a plain
--   supabase.from('memory_items').select('project, source_type, category')
-- which hits PostgREST's default 1000-row cap. On a store with 3,397 active
-- rows the `by_project` / `by_source_type` / `by_category` histograms only
-- summed to ~1000 even though `total_active` was correct. Pushing the GROUP
-- BY server-side eliminates the cap and saves the round-trip of streaming
-- every row to the client just to count them.
--
-- Safe to re-run — CREATE OR REPLACE.
